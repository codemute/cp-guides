# Competitive Programming - All the guides you'll ever need!

Competitive programming does seriously test our logical thinking and our
problem solving skills extensively. It is also one of the most demanded
criteria in many of the software development companies. Keeping that
aside, competitive programming is a lot of fun sometimes. I mean who doesn't
like puzzles! :smile: But, to get better in competitive programming is a much
difficult job. If you aren't consistently practicing then chances are you would
struggle in contests losing many things on the way.

To keep you on track, we've been adding all the guides we found to 'master'
in competitive programming. We know that its all just practice, but its
important that you practice harder and more challenging examples. Printing
'Hello world' thousands of times won't help you out. Also, printing it in
tons of languages also doesn't make any sense. All you need to know is how
to print it, no matter which language you use.

Well, here is the list of the guides available and their estimated length
(to complete) along with their difficulties and ratings. Here, the ratings
and the lengths are calculated relatively (and may not be accurate), so keep
that in mind. Have fun! :smile:

**Note:** These guides are meant to help you get better in competitive
programming, interviews, etc. but none of them *guarantee* any sort of success.
They can only *guide* you but in the end, your practice and perseverance are
the only factors affecting your success.
